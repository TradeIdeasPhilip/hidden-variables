      <h1>Goal</h1>
      <p>
        My solution to hidden variables, spooky action at a distance, Bell's
        inequality, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am proposing a fairly simple model of a hidden variable. This removes
        the need for “spooky action at a distance.”
      </p>
      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>This model contains only three things.</p>

      <h1>Particle</h1>
      <p>Imagine a photon or an electron.</p>
      <p>
        I'm drawing the particles as spheres for convenience. In fact, the
        particles might be points or might be too small to measure. The
        important thing is that I can highlight directions relative to the
        particle.
      </p>
      <h1>Measurement</h1>
      <p>
        Think quantum spin. These are the standard measurements. I have
        <i>not</i> performed any new experiments. I am adding a new
        interpretation to well known measurements.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can control the direction the measurement equipment is pointing. You
        can describe these with two numbers, analogous to longitude and
        latitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        For simplicity I always place the measuring device flat on the screen. I
        will only measures points on the edge of the sphere. I can still measure
        any two points that I choose. I might have to rotate the particle,
        instead of the detector. That's an insignificant detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        The output of the measurement is a single value. In this representation
        the result will be a color. The output can be interpreted as any Boolean
        value, e.g. true vs. false, spin up vs. spin down, kill the cat vs spare
        the cat.
      </p>
      <h1>Hidden Variable</h1>
      <p>This is my take. I have not seen this anywhere else.</p>
      <p>
        When we talk about a quantum property like spin or polarization, I
        represent that as a direction: Which way is the orange side pointing?
        You can describe this as two numbers, the latitude and the longitude of
        the center of the orange hemisphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you make a measurement, two things happen. The first part is
        completely deterministic. If the measurement apparatus is pointing
        anywhere in the orange area, the result will be orange. Otherwise the
        result will be white.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second step is to randomize the direction of the orange part. The
        resulting position will <u>not</u> change the result if the exact same
        test is repeated. I.e. only half the possible directions are legal.
        Aside from that it is impossible to predict the exact direction after
        the measurement, so I will call the new direction <i>random</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is how my version of a hidden variable differs from the versions
        I've seen. My measurement step is always deterministic. There is
        randomness at the end of my measurement, but the random value will not
        be used until the next measurement.
      </p>
      <h1>Example: Single Particle</h1>
      <div class="stage-direction">
        Measure it once then rotate n° and measure it again.
      </div>
      <h1>Example: Entangled Particles</h1>
      <div class="stage-direction">
        Create 2 particles with random but opposite hidden variables. Show them
        moving away from each other, toward 2 pieces of measuring equipment. One
        will always point straight down. The other will spin around to a random
        place, but still on the outside of the circle. Measure both. Keep tables
        keeping track of the results. Repeat animation forever.
      </div>
      <h1>Example: Three in a Row</h1>
      <div class="stage-direction">
        I think I can use a very similar model for polarized light.
        <br />
        <br />
        Add an animation showing a photon going through multiple sheets of
        polarized film. Show one photon at a time. Keep score on the screen.
        Allow the user to adjust the rotations.
        <br />
        <br />
        This should work very similar to the entangled particles, but I will
        need to tweak a couple of things. In this case I need a period of 180°.
        If the center of the orange side is pointing in a specific direction, or
        the center of the white side is pointing in that direction, I need to
        treat those cases identically. In the previous two examples, those two
        cases were exact opposites.
        <br />
        <br />
        In fact, the half orange / half white spheres probably need to change. I
        can imagine a circle with a stripe through the middle. The direction of
        the stripe corresponds to the direction of the polarization. And the
        180° symmetry will be obvious.
        <br />
        <br />
        There isn't any need for a 3d object, like a sphere. We only have 1
        degree of freedom in this example. Light can't be polarized in the same
        direction that it moves!
