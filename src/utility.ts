/**
 * This is similar to `numerator % denominator`, i.e. modulo division.
 * The difference is that the result will never be negative.
 * If the numerator is negative `%`  will return a negative number.
 *
 * If the 0 point is chosen arbitrarily then you should use `positiveModulo()` rather than `%`.
 * For example, C's `time_t` and JavaScript's `Date.prototype.valueOf()` say that 0 means midnight January 1, 1970.
 * Negative numbers refer to times before midnight January 1, 1970, and positive numbers refer to times after midnight January 1, 1970.
 * But midnight January 1, 1970 was chosen arbitrarily, and you probably don't want to treat times before that differently than times after that.
 * And how many people would even think to test a negative date?
 *
 * `positiveModulo(n, d)` will give the same result as `positiveModulo(n + d, d)` for all vales of `n` and `d`.
 * (You might get 0 sometimes and -0 other times, but those are both `==` so I'm not worried about that.)
